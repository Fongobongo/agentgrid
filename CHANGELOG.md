# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [0.1.0] - Unreleased

### Added
- Cargo workspace scaffold: `common`, `control-plane`, `node-daemon`, `cli`, `adapters`.
- Shared types and API DTOs (`crates/common`): task/attempt/node status enums, event model, `/v1` request/response types, serde round-trip tests.
- In-memory control plane (`crates/control-plane`): Axum server with health, task CRUD, node long-poll assignment, event ingest (idempotent), attempt completion. First-fit scheduler respects `requested_node_id` and node capacity.
- Node daemon (`crates/node-daemon`): long-poll loop, adapter subprocess in a per-attempt worktree and separate process group, stdout/stderr streamed as batched events, completion reporting.
- Mock adapter (`crates/adapters`): deterministic `sleep:`/`write:`/`fail:`/`spam:` commands emitting JSON-line events; no LLM required.
- Minimal CLI (`crates/cli`): `task run`, `task logs --follow`, `task show`, `node list`.
- Integration test exercising the full task lifecycle and event idempotency.
- ADR recording Stage 0.1 scope decisions (`docs/decisions/0001-mvp-scope.md`).

### Scope note
This is the Stage-1 vertical prototype. Persistence (SQLite WAL), auth, Git worktrees, real adapters and web UI follow in later stages.

### Added (Stage 2.1 / 2.2 — persistence + state machine)
- SQLite storage layer (`crates/control-plane/src/store.rs`) with bundled `libsqlite3-sys`, WAL,
  `synchronous=NORMAL`, `busy_timeout=5000`, 4-connection pool, and `sqlx` migrations.
- Atomic assignment via a short write transaction with `UPDATE ... WHERE status='queued'` +
  `rows_affected` check, so concurrent schedulers can never double-assign.
- Pure task/attempt state-machine transition functions (`crates/common/src/state_machine.rs`)
  with exhaustive unit tests for allowed and forbidden transitions.
- Idempotent event ingest (`ON CONFLICT(attempt_id, sequence) DO NOTHING`).
- Background maintenance: lease-expiry revert of unconfirmed assignments; node-offline sweep.
- `health/ready` now verifies SQLite reachability; integration tests run on a temp SQLite DB.

### Verified
- End-to-end on one machine: `task run` → mock adapter writes file → `succeeded`, logs stream.
- Control-plane restart on the same SQLite file preserves queued tasks (WAL).
